# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 5/30/2025

This Privacy Policy describes how our Android application ("Class Lock") handles personal data. The App is designed for use in educational settings, allowing teachers to manage student devices locally via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We are committed to protecting user privacy and complying with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

---

## 1. Data Collection

We do **not collect**, store, or transmit any personal data to our servers or to any third party.

- The App operates entirely **offline**.
- Communication between student and teacher devices occurs **locally via BLE**.
- We do **not use or process any identifiable user data**, such as names, email addresses, or device identifiers.
- No usage analytics or tracking technologies (e.g., cookies, third-party SDKs) are implemented.

---

## 2. Use of Bluetooth

The App uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to:

- Allow teacher devices to manage the list of apps shown on student devices.
- Enable teachers to open apps remotely on behalf of students.

These operations are strictly local and temporary. No data is transmitted over the internet or stored outside the devices involved.

---

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing

Under the GDPR, since no personal data is processed or stored, no legal basis such as consent or legitimate interest is required.

However, the App may be used by educational institutions as part of their authorized learning tools. In that case, any role-based management is handled **entirely under the school’s control**, and subject to their internal data policies.

---

## 4. Children’s Privacy

The App is designed for use by students under the supervision of schools and educators. No personal data of children is collected, stored, or processed by the App.

Schools using the App are responsible for ensuring lawful and appropriate use in accordance with local regulations, including GDPR and any applicable children’s data protection laws.

---

## 5. Data Security

Although no personal data is processed, we implement reasonable technical safeguards to protect device communication via BLE, ensuring it is limited to authorized teacher-student pairs within a secure, short-range connection.

---

## 6. Your Rights Under GDPR

As no personal data is collected or processed by us, the rights provided under GDPR (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, portability) do not apply in this context.

Any queries or rights requests related to app use should be directed to the **educational institution** managing the devices.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in legal requirements or app functionality. You will be notified via the App or through your school if any material changes occur.
